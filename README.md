# 🎓 Predict Student Dropout XGBoost and_Neural Networks

---

## Project Background

This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict student dropout risk across three stages of the student journey:

1. **Stage 1 – Early:** Applicant and course information  
2. **Stage 2 – Mid:** Student engagement and attendance behaviour  
3. **Stage 3 – Late:** Academic performance metrics  

Student retention is critical for institutional financial stability 💰, academic outcomes 🎯, and overall student satisfaction 😊. Predicting dropout risk allows targeted interventions at different stages, optimising resource allocation and maximising retention.

The analysis leverages both **XGBoost** and **Neural Network** models to evaluate predictive performance at each stage, highlighting how feature availability affects model accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Objective

- Explore student datasets across three stages  
- Preprocess and engineer features, including demographic, behavioural, and academic performance data  
- Predict dropout using XGBoost and Neural Networks  
- Optimise models via hyperparameter tuning for maximum F1 score ⚡  
- Compare models and stages to determine best strategies for intervention  

---

## Data Overview

- **Stage 1:** Demographics, course, and institutional features (25,059 rows, 16 columns)  
- **Stage 2:** Adds attendance behaviour features (Authorised and Unauthorised Absences)  
- **Stage 3:** Adds academic performance features (Assessed, Passed, Failed Modules)  

Data preprocessing included:
- Dropping identifiers and columns with >50% missing values  
- Converting dates to age  
- Binary, ordinal, and one-hot encoding  
- Mean imputation for missing performance metrics

## Model Summary

### Stage 1 – Early Risk

**Neural Network (NN1)**  
- F1 improved from 0.567 → 0.636  
- Recall: 0.498 → 0.691 ✅  
- Precision: 0.658 → 0.590  

**XGBoost (XGB1)**  
- Initial F1 = 0; Optimised F1 = 0.610  
- Recall: 0.549, Precision: 0.687  
- Feature importance dominated by nationality and centre-related features  

**Insight:** Early intervention prioritises recall; NN1 better flags at-risk students, XGB1 reduces false positives.

### Stage 2 – Mid-Course Risk

**Neural Network (NN2)**  
- F1: 0.599 → 0.663  
- Recall: 0.500 → 0.670 ✅  
- Precision: 0.746 → 0.657  

**XGBoost (XGB2)**  
- F1: 0 → 0.665  
- Recall: 0.598, Precision: 0.749  
- Institutional and course features gain predictive weight  

**Insight:** Mid-course prediction balances recall and precision; NN2 detects slightly more potential dropouts, XGB2 is more precise, reducing unnecessary interventions.

---

### Stage 3 – Late-Stage Risk

**Neural Network (NN3)**  
- F1: 0.787 → 0.866  
- Recall: 0.742 → 0.809 ✅  
- Precision: 0.838 → 0.931  

**XGBoost (XGB3)**  
- F1: 0 → 0.921 🌟  
- Recall: 0.909, Precision: 0.934  
- Academic performance features dominate feature importance  

**Insight:** Late-stage prediction requires high precision and recall. XGB3 offers the most reliable predictions for targeted retention efforts.

## Cross-Stage Analysis

- Predictive performance improves as more features become available 📈  
- Feature importance shifts: demographics → institutional/course context → academic performance  
- Early-stage interventions must accept some false positives; mid-stage allows selective targeting; late-stage focuses on high-certainty cases  

**Model Selection Guidance:**  
- **Stage 1:** Prioritise NN for recall  
- **Stage 2:** Trade-off between NN recall and XGB precision  
- **Stage 3:** XGB dominates for high-confidence retention targeting  

---

## Key Takeaways

- Optimisation consistently improved F1 scores, balancing recall and precision per stage ⚡  
- Absence and academic performance features provide strong predictive signals  
- Neural Networks and XGBoost each have advantages depending on stage and intervention goals  
- Feature evolution reflects real-world information availability and guides stage-specific strategies

## Recommendations

- **Stage 1 – Early Intervention:** Use NN1 predictions to flag potential at-risk students based on demographic and course information. Implement broad preventative measures such as orientation support, engagement campaigns, and attendance monitoring.  

- **Stage 2 – Mid-Course Intervention:** Combine NN2 and XGB2 outputs to balance recall and precision. Target students showing early signs of disengagement or attendance issues with personalised outreach, mentoring, and academic support.  

- **Stage 3 – Late-Stage Intervention:** Prioritise XGB3 predictions for high-confidence identification of students at immediate risk 🌟. Implement intensive retention efforts, such as one-on-one tutoring, academic counselling, and tailored support plans.  

- **Feature-Based Strategies:**  
  - Monitor attendance and absence patterns closely to identify early risk indicators  
  - Track academic performance metrics (Assessed, Passed, Failed Modules) for targeted intervention  
  - Leverage demographic and institutional features to personalise support programmes  

- **Operational Actions:**  
  - Allocate resources dynamically based on predicted risk stage  
  - Develop automated dashboards to monitor dropout risk in real time  
  - Regularly retrain models with new student data to maintain predictive accuracy  
  - Coordinate cross-departmental intervention strategies involving faculty, tutors, and student support services  

- **Policy Recommendations:**  
  - Establish early-warning protocols for students flagged at each stage  
  - Invest in engagement initiatives during the first weeks of courses to reduce early-stage dropout risk  
  - Implement targeted support for students struggling academically in late-stage courses  
  - Review and refine institutional and course-level policies that influence student retention
